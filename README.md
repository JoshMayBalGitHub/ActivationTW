# ActivationTW
ActivationTW, a idea i had for ""activating"" my game.


## Downloading from source / Setup.sh
Keep in mind that the Setup.sh depends on the directory being:

 ./C#Programs/"Console App".csproj
 
 So, if you want to test that out you have to put all of it in the C#Programs folder i put in, except of course the Setup.sh.
 
 ### Setup.sh executable problems
 
 Also, **Note,** for some reason i can not make Setup.sh executable in github so you gonna have to do it yourself. 
 
 I hate it so much...
