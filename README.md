# ActivationTW
ActivationTW, a idea i had for ""activating"" my game.


## Downloading from source / Setup.sh
Keep in mind that the Setup.sh depends on the directory being:

 ./C#Programs/"Console App".csproj
 
 So, if you want to test that out you have to put all of it in the C#Programs folder i put in, except of course the Setup.sh.
 
 ### Setup.sh executable problems
 
 Also, **Note,** for some reason i can not make Setup.sh executable in github so you gonna have to do it yourself. 
 
 Also, i just realized that github doesnt save it, when displaying source code, it doesnt save unix permissions but .zip, .tar, any compression stuff fixes that, because it keeps it, idk why it works like that...
 
 I hate it so much...
