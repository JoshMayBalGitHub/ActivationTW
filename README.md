# ActivationTW
ActivationTW, a idea i had for ""activating"" my game.


## Setup.sh
Keep in mind that the Setup.sh deoends on the directory being:

 ./C#Programs/"Console App".csproj
 
 So, if you want to test that out you have to put all of it in the C#Programs folder i put in except ofcourse the Setup.sh
